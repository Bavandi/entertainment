                    <p>A nightclub is usually an entertainment venue that includes a dance floor, laser light show, and
                        stage for a disc jockey (DJ). The naming of &#8220;night club&#8221; has changed over time.
                        These places, which were called discos or discotheques at first, are now called nightclubs or
                        just clubs.</p>
